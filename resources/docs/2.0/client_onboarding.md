## Creating a Client Account

As a Project Manager or Team Leader, you have the possibility to create new client accounts. 
This can be done by going into the Project Manager area, and clicking on the `Add` button at the top right.

## Client Account Creation Form
This will lead to the client account creation form.  
Enter the _name_ of the client, and the _slug_ field will be automatically generated.  

The _alias_ field contains all the ways a client can be named in MySGS. 
A later section will explain how to fill this up.

It is also recommended to upload a logo of the client, a square format is optimal.

You will automatically become the Team Owner for that client account.

## Aliases
One client can have many names in the real world, and therefore in MySGS.  
This is where aliases come into play. We have a list of unified client account names, and you need to select which 
aliases are relevant to your Dagobah client account. 

E.g Dannon (US) and Danone (FR), although falling under the unified account **Danone**, could have different sets of 
rules and therefore Dagobah client accounts.

To access this list, go to the `Admin` section, under `MySGS Client Account`

Search for your client's name.

And click on the eye button to view all the names available for this client in MySGS.

Copy the relevant ones for your client account into the aliases field, available in the Project Manager section under
`Settings`. (Using two tabs would be best).

## Client Account Categories

By default, a set of categories are created for the new client account. These fall under two main categories:  
- Account Structure, which are mapped against MySGS to auto-filter rules.
- Job Categorizations, which are used to classify the rules in the operators' view.


### Account Structure
No terms are added by default (save for `ANY`). You are free to add your own terms, but make sure they match the ones
used in MySGS.  
E.g for Pack-Type, if you have the option _TUBE_ in MySGS, add the term _TUBE_ in Dagobah.

### Job Categorizations
Categories have terms pre-filled.

## Adding a Term
To add a term to a category, simply click on the `+` button next to the category's terms. A window will appear where 
you can write the term and save.
